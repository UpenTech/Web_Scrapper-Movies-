Hey, You want a list of some top rated movies, haah? Of course you do
that's why you're here. Let's get down to business.

#Introduction
Running this code fetches **50 top rated movies** from imdb's webpage
and displays it to the user along with its rating. 
[^1]: That's all it does. Told you earlier not to come to my repo's with
higher expectations. 

#Requirements
For those with python interpreter installed in their devices you basically
only need to install **beautifulsoup4** and **requests** library and just run the python file (codeFile.py).
While the others first have to install the python interpreter and proceed with the above mentioned steps.

It's a bit tedious work for non-technical people, isn't it? Fear not, taking these things into consideration
I've added the entire python virtual environment here with everything already setup. 
Just clone this repository or get the things in this repositoory and run the python file.

For those who only want to copy the code file and run themself, just run these commands if you don't have the required libraries installed and run the python code.
##Installing the Libraries
Go to your terminal emulator and run the following commands. (I'm presuming you have pip installed on your device.)
1. `pip install beautifulsoup4`
2. 'pip install requests'

#Running Code
Use the command;
`python codeFile.py`
(You need to be in the same directory containing the file for this command to work)

Enjoy! Fellas
